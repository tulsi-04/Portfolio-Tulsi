# Profile Image Setup

## Adding Your Profile Image

1. Save your profile image as `profile.jpg` in this directory (`client/public/`)
2. The image should be:
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger (square format works best)
   - The image will be displayed as a circular avatar in the Hero section

## Current Configuration

The profile image path is set to: `/profile.jpg`

This means the image file should be located at: `client/public/profile.jpg`

## Image Display

The profile image is displayed in:
- Hero section (main landing area)
- Circular format with neon border effects
- Responsive sizing (128px mobile, 160px desktop)

If the image is not found, the portfolio will display initials (TK) as a fallback.
